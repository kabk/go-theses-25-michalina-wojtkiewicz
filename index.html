        <h2>Abstract</h2>
      </div>

      <p>We spend around one-third of our lives asleep. For centuries sleep
      was perceived as a deeply private and mysterious state of
      unconsciousness, beyond scientific explanation, often associated with
      transcendence, vulnerability, eroticism, and death. As someone who
      easily falls asleep in public spaces‚Äîon trams, in taxis, or even at the
      hairdresser‚Äôs‚ÄîI am interested in the complex relationship between the
      sleeper, their environment, and the observer. When we become sleepers
      our vigilance decreases and we become vulnerable and dependent on our
      direct surroundings. How does the act of sleeping in public alter our
      perception of safety, agency, and exposure?</p>


      <p>This research examines the portrayal and cultural significance of
      sleep throughout history from a Western perspective, drawing from
      various sources, including artistic depictions‚ÄîGiorgione‚Äôs <em>Sleeping
      Venus</em>, psychological and neurological insights from Rahul Jandial
      and Matthew Walker, and evolutionary perspectives on vulnerability
      during sleep from Lawrence Wichlinski and Benjamin Reiss. Additionally,
      I explore contemporary sleep-related phenomena, such as ‚Äúsleep
      streaming‚Äù, performative sleep in art by Sofie Calle and Tilda Swinton,
      and social trends like <em>sleepmaxxing</em>. By analyzing these
      representations, this study seeks to understand how sleep functions not
      only as a biological necessity but also as a performative and cultural
      act shaped by historical and societal contexts.</p>

      <p>You‚Äôre sitting on a train after a long day of travel. Your eyes start
      closing, your hand slowly relaxes from how tight you‚Äôve held your phone.
      Suddenly, your leg shakes and your whole body straightens up in seconds.
      You feel slightly embarrassed. <em>Did I touch anyone during my nap? Did
      my mouth open and I snored?</em> You quickly look around, straighten up
      even more, organize your things, and start scrolling your phone to keep
      your mind awake. But the dreams keep fighting their way back. Do you
      resist your overwhelming need for sleep or let it happen?</p>
      <p>You give in, and your whole body follows. Your legs stretch forward,
      awkwardly close to the passenger sitting in front, and your head leans
      backward letting your neck relax. While still hearing the voices of kids
      playing cards on seats behind you and a crackling announcement of the
      conductor in the background you start seeing images and shapes. They
      keep changing and merging, your brain makes a story from the noises of
      your surroundings. You just entered the state of liminal dreaming, your
      mind is still present but already started drifting away. Just moments
      away you are gone, the voices go silent, the images calm down and you‚Äôre
      unapologetically sleeping on the train.</p>
      <p>Congrats. Better keep your belongings close. Just in case.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </div>
      <p>As a person who can easily fall asleep in any given moment and place,
      I‚Äôve been interested in the relationship between the sleeper and its
      environment. It‚Äôs usual for me to nap on the hairdresser‚Äôs chair,
      massage bed, or in the tram, five min before my stop. I‚Äôve been
      experiencing motion sickness my whole life, and sleep has always been an
      easy remedy for it. It relaxes your body and disconnects you from any
      pain or discomfort you might be experiencing. Sleeping in the car next
      to a partner or family member is a safe nap, a moment of gathering
      energy before reaching the destination. A bus, plane, or train, has the
      same effect on me as a car but doesn‚Äôt come with the same privacy and
      comfort. It swings and moves making it irresistible for me to stay
      awake. As someone who doesn‚Äôt hesitate before napping in public, I‚Äôm
      going to investigate the other side, how the environment experiences the
      person who sleeps in it.  </p>

        <h2>The Unique Vulnerability of the Sleeper
      <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></h2></div>
      <p>We become the sleeper, in the moment when we transition between
      wakefulness to sleep. During N1, the first non-rem stage of sleep, the
      body becomes paralyzed. Our organism releases neurotransmitters that
      switch off our motor function, allowing us to sleep safely without
      acting out our dreams. Next, the Executive Network turns off. As Jandial
      wrote, it allows us to ignore normal rules of time, space, and reason. <a
      href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
      <p>Our body limits our responsiveness and vigilance, causing us to
      become exposed to outside predators and threats of the nighttime.
      Although nowadays we are mostly safe from unsheltered sleep and
      intruders, awaiting our moment of inattention, we are still in an
      exposed position when asleep. When resting, especially in public, we
      rely on our surroundings and social trust. Without such trust, we would
      fall into the loop of anxiety-induced insomnia, when a fear of losing
      the ability to remain vigilant enables us to rest, which especially
      concerns patients with post-traumatic stress disorder. <a href="#fn3"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
      <p>The phrase ‚Äòlosing consciousness‚Äô, implies that we lose the ability
      to stay present, it happens involuntarily. We could argue it doesn‚Äôt
      concern sleep, as we can mostly control when our body falls into it. We
      have access to many ways of supporting our wakefulness. Caffeine, energy
      drinks, or even blue light on our laptops allow us to work late hours.
      But in a controlled state of falling asleep, there is still a
      transitional moment, a liminal space between awake and sleep when this
      disconnection between our mind and reality happens. This phenomenon was
      named hypnagogia, from Greek words œçœÄŒΩŒøœÇ (‚Äòhypnos‚Äô), meaning ‚Äòsleep‚Äô,
      and Œ±Œ≥œâŒ≥œåœÇ (‚Äòag≈çgos‚Äô), meaning ‚Äòconductor‚Äô or ‚Äòleader‚Äô, as well as the
      corresponding hypnopompic state originating from the Greek word
      ‚Äòpompos‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòsender‚Äô describing the transition from sleep to
      wakefulness. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The moment when you become the
      sleeper, your mind not being occupied by images, and digital content has
      a space to unlock its visual madness. This first stage of falling
      asleep, lasting approximately one to seven minutes, has been speculated
      to be one of the key elements to unleashing our creativity. Salvador
      Dali, being aware of hypnagogic hallucinations, invented a technique
      that helped him create his surrealistic paintings. He would sleep with a
      key in his hand and a metal plate on the floor, when falling asleep key
      would slip from his fingers hitting the metal, resulting in him waking
      up. The technique allowed him to capture the dreams of the N1 stage and
      immediately translate them into paper. <a href="#fn5"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> As
      Jandial writes in <em>This is Why You Dream</em>, researchers at the
      Paris Brain Institute put Dali‚Äôs experiment to the test. They gave
      participants a puzzle, those who didn‚Äôt manage to solve it, got a
      twenty-minute break and an instruction to try falling asleep with a key
      in their hand. They discovered that a single minute of sleep onset
      resulted in an insight. The participants who entered the sleep were
      almost three times as likely to solve the puzzle as those who remained
      awake. <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
      <p>By balancing on the sleep-entry moment we access a different state of
      consciousness, where our mind operates outside of logic and structured
      reasoning. It‚Äôs a form of thinking inaccessible to us when we‚Äôre awake,
      and completely detached from the constraints of rationality and social
      rules. As a result, it can also become a moment when our mind confronts
      us with our fears and unresolved thoughts. That‚Äôs why hypnagogia might
      be associated with sleep paralysis; a state in which the body entering
      sleep is still and immobile, while its semi-conscious mind produces
      vivid and terrifying hallucinations. While we lose control over our
      consciousness and body, it‚Äôs the moment when our mind can think, create,
      and speculate freely not distracted by technology and restrained by
      rules of reality.</p>

      <p>During COVID-19 most of us felt deprived of intimacy and connection
      due to forced isolation and rigorous restrictions. Zoom and Skype calls
      became the main source of social interaction and many people found
      comfort in falling asleep together on video calls. This intimate act
      became a scheduled activity. People crave to see their partner in a
      vulnerable state of relaxation and to feel that someone is keeping an
      eye on them too. This need to observe our loved ones when asleep
      originates from our evolutionary past when vigilance during vulnerable
      sleeping hours was crucial for survival. <a href="#fn7"

      In Western culture, we perceive sleep as a deeply private state. We sleep
      in separate rooms, and if that‚Äôs not possible - beds. It‚Äôs recommended
      to separate children from parents during the night as soon as possible,
      to ensure their proper development.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> But it‚Äôs a relatively
      new approach. Sleep was not always associated with privacy, until the
      mid-19th Century it was communal. People shared a bed with their relatives, friends, co-workers, or even strangers. The bed-sharing
      provided the feeling of security and warmth and gave space to share
      thoughts, and tales and discuss dreams. Seeping together didn‚Äôt have the
      same sexual connotations as today, royals and high-ranked people who
      didn‚Äôt suffer from a shortage of rooms and beds still had bed-mates.
      Bed-sharing started to quickly decrease in the mid-19th Century. As
      Gorvett writes ‚ÄòIt all began with an influential American physician.
      William Whitty Hall, who had strong opinions on many subjects, became a
      passionate advocate of the idea that communal sleep was not only unwise

      <p>In art, sleep is shown much more individualistic than history would
      suggest. The motif of the sleeper always held deep religious, erotic, or
      moralistic meaning, and was rarely represented in a natural and
      documentary way. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt find many images of people sleeping
      communally, but represented sleepers are usually exposed and isolated.
      One of the oldest examples of the sleeping figure is a Neolithic clay
      sculpture called <em>The Sleeping Lady</em> (c.3,000 BCE) found in
      Malta. <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
      <p>She is lying on her side, with
      a skirt covering her lower body. The figurine‚Äôs pose becomes a recurrent
      motif in Renaissance and Baroque paintings, particularly mythological
      representations of Venus, Danae, or Ariadne. Giorgione‚Äôs painting
      <em>Sleeping Venus</em> (1510),
      <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> is one of the most
      recognizable representations of the sleeping figure from that period.
      She is portrayed as peacefully resting, absorbed in a world beyond
      consciousness, and completely exposed to the viewer, shown as powerless
      and available.</p>
      <p>She is not aware that someone is observing her, she‚Äôs not looking at
      the viewer, ignoring or hiding. Sleep is often associated with eroticism
      as well as innocence, it‚Äôs also viewed as parallel to death. Ancients
      represented sleepers in tombs and burial places, as sleep was believed
      to be a ‚Äòtemporary death‚Äô and death was believed to be an ‚Äòeternal
      sleep‚Äô. Historical tendencies in painting sleeping women might suggest
      that women are most desirable when inanimate. Kryger writes in <em>The
      Atlas</em> ‚ÄòA sleeping woman takes on the posture of death but is very
      much alive. She is conscious but not cognizant. She lies physically in
      reality, but her thoughts run in fantasy. Sleep delights, frightens,
      regenerates, and may even lead to fatigue. It can overpower like a
      heavy, irrepressible fog or elude us like the sweet thrills of
      happiness.‚Äô <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Artists who wanted to portray the
      female body often reached for the motif of the dead or sleeping women.
      They used them as mannequins where their thoughts and feelings were
      disregarded and pushed into the background. Their environment tells a
      story, but they exist in it unaware of what‚Äôs happening. Sleep is less
      macabre than death but the line separating them is very thin. We can
      never be sure if the sleeper in the image is alive.</p>
   
      <p>In Romanticism, painters remained fascinated by the sleepers but
      managed to enrich them by representing their unconscious mind. In the
      painting <em>The Nightmare</em> (1781) by Hendry Fuseli, 
      a young woman
      lays on her side, her arms are open, exposing her chest. Her pose
      reminds Renaissance representations, but the image is no longer
      peaceful, the figure of the incubus sits heavily on her stomach, the
      black horse peaks from the dark curtains, and her arms are not relaxed
      from spiritual or erotic ecstasy, but from fear and vulnerability.
      Fuseli introduces the darker and demonic side of the dreaming mind. The
      incubus is often interpreted as a depiction of ‚Äòsleep paralysis‚Äô, that
      threatens the mind and enables movement of the body. The woman in the
      painting is fully dressed, which signifies that the depiction of the
      sleeper holds now deeper meaning than just showing the beauty of the
      female body.</p>

      </span> 
  
      <p>The motif of the sleeping mind became widely explored in the
      20<sup>th</sup> Century, with the publication of <em>The Interpretation
      of Dreams</em> (1900) by Sigmund Freud. <a href="#fn13"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
      Many surrealist painters started looking for links between dreams and
      creativity. As mentioned in Chapter 1, Salvador Dali experimented with a
      hypnagogic state, and the painting <em>Dream Caused by the Flight of a
      Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening</em> (1944) was a
      direct result of it. The woman in the image seems to be represented
      similarly to the Renaissance depictions of the sleepers. Yet, she is not
      sleeping on the bed but in a fantastic world surrounded by her dreams.
      Dali, like Fuseli, represents the mind together with the body of the
      sleeper.</p>

      </span>
      <p>In those depictions, we observe a subjective interpretation of the
      sleeping body. With the development of video and photography artists
      could take on the role of the documentarians. It allowed them to record
      and capture moments of everyday life, in an almost objective way.</p>
      <p>One of the first films of Andy Warhol, 
    created as an ‚Äòani-film‚Äô, was
      over five-hour-long footage of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Giorno">John Giorno</a>,
      Warhol‚Äôs lover at the time, sleeping. <a href="#fn14"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
      He translates the passive state of Giorno‚Äôs sleep into an active
      observation and documentation. As mothers watch their newborns sleeping,
      partners look at their loved ones. We, viewers, come as strangers and
      are put in the uncomfortable situation of active observation of someone
      in an intimate and private moment of rest.</p>

      <p>Sofie Calle in her work <em>The Sleepers</em> (1979) puts herself in
      a position similar to us, viewers in Andy Warhol‚Äôs movie. She invites
      her friends, acquaintances, and strangers to spend a night in her bed,
      among them 27 agree with the experiment. Calle described her work as ‚ÄòI
      asked people to give me eight hours of their sleep. To come and sleep in
      my bed‚Ä¶I asked a few questions. I took photographs every hour. I watched
      my guests sleep.‚Äô <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"

      <p>She photographed them awake and asleep and secretly recorded their
      intimate conversations behind closed doors. The next day she served them
      a meal and asked about their experience, their interpretation of the act
      of sleeping in her bed, their habits, beliefs, and dreams. During the
      research, guests and artists formed an intimate bond, Calle observed
      them asleep when they occupied her most private space, her bed. She
      captions photographs with fragments of conversations, which gives the
      viewer a look inside the mind of the portrayed person. This artwork
      examines sleepers in a consensual and collaborative way that requires
      trust from both sides.</p>
      <p>When we compare Giorgione‚Äôs <em>Sleeping Venus</em> with Calle‚Äôs
      <em>The Sleepers</em> we see a clear difference in representation.
      Giorgione sees his model as beautiful and desirable, he duplicates the
      curves of her body in the landscape creating a harmonious composition.
      Venus holds her right arm under the head and uses her left hand to cover
      the genitals. She‚Äôs lying outside, but her body is not covered by
      anything. The state of sleep in this painting serves as an opportunity
      for the viewer to stare at the naked female body, without the feeling of
      being observed back. In <em>The Sleepers</em> Calle shifts the focus
      from an idealized, isolated figure to an intimate, collective moment.
      Rather than presenting a singular figure, solely for the viewer‚Äôs gaze,
      she investigates a quiet nature of sleep‚Äîa state where personal barriers
      fall away.</p>

          <h2>Sleep as Performance</h2>
        </div>

      <p>In 1995 Tilda Swinton spent seven days motionless in a glass vitrine
      in the Serpentine Gallery in London. 
      She came there every day and slept for eight hours. As Miranda Whall writes ‚ÄòShe lay still for viewers of
      the gallery to witness her, stare at her, examine her, laugh at her,
      wonder, question, dismiss, and leave‚Äô (Hall, 2017). <a href="#fn16"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
      She was laying on a white mattress and white pillow, wearing sneakers,
      long pants, and a shirt. Swinton created an environment to explore the
      relationship between the artist, who becomes an artwork, and the
      spectator. The artist seems unconscious, which allows viewers to come
      much closer than they would normally. What purpose does the glass wall
      serve? Does Swinton not trust the visitors and feels the need to
      separate and protect herself? Does the glass act as a symbolic barrier
      between performance and reality, emphasizing the artificiality of the
      spectacle? The installation invited viewers to confront their own
      complicity in voyeurism‚Äîwas their presence passive, or did their gaze
      turn the sleeping artist into an object of entertainment?</p>

      <p>In the early 2000s, the reality TV series <em>Big Brother</em> gained
      a lot of attention and became one of the world‚Äôs most-watched shows. <a
      href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> It was groundbreaking, never before
      viewers could watch regular people living their lives on television
      under constant surveillance. It gave people a close look into all
      aspects of participant‚Äôs reality and everyday activities, which we
      usually do alone. What surprised the producers, was the popularity of
      recording when participants were asleep. As Tilda Swinton in <em>The
      Maybe</em> separated herself by glass vitrine, people watched the lives
      of others through a glass screen 24/7. Now, we witness people
      oversharing intimate details and parts of their lives for engagement
      online every single day. It became so normalized, that we‚Äôre no longer
      surprised when people find new, strange ways to make money by selling
      their privacy through social media. During COVID-19 many influencers
      started streaming themselves while sleeping. It was supposed to make
      viewers feel less alone and isolated, as well as help them with
      insomnia. When streamers realized how much engagement it created, some
      of them decided to let viewers disturb and control their sleep. One of
      the most popular Twitch streamers, Cosplayer Amouranth, set up a bell, 
      that rang whenever new 20 people subscribed to her channel. <a

      <p>It postponed the alarm an hour, allowing her to sleep longer. She
      also revealed that more people watch her when she sleeps, than when
      she‚Äôs awake, and that number of viewers increase significantly when it‚Äôs
      close to her waking time. Some streamers go way further, giving people
      multiple options to disrupt them. For example, StanleyMov allows his
      viewers who pay $95, to give him an electric shock through a bracelet he
      wears, $12 to make his lights flicker or $24 to blind him with a very
      bright light. <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Here, the interaction between
      performer and audience has evolved into something more transactional,
      where participation is not just encouraged but monetized, blurring the
      line between engagement and exploitation. The body, once a site of rest,
      is now a performative subject to control‚Äîraising broader concerns about
      surveillance and the commodification of personal space.</p>
      <p>In 2006, during <em>The Generational Triennial: Younger Than
      Jesus</em>, Chu Yun 
      put a bed in the middle of the gallery space. During
      the exhibition, a rotating group of paid volunteers slept in the bed
      after ingesting sleeping aids. The participants consisted of women aged
      18 to 40 who became living sculptures for a few hours. Yun with her work
      <em>This is XX</em> reflects upon the representation of the female body
      in art and the motif of the sleeper. Participants are only able to sleep
      due to pills, suggesting that they are not in a state of relaxation and
      rest, but vulnerability and withdrawal. Just like Sleeping Beauty and
      Snow White, whose unconscious states were imposed upon them by external
      forces‚Äîa cursed spindle and a poisoned apple‚Äîthe women in <em>This is
      XX</em> become passive subjects due to sleeping aids. The stillness of
      the sleepers recalls a long tradition of idealized, immobile women in
      visual culture‚Äîfrom classical reclining nudes to contemporary
      advertising. Unlike Swinton, who made a deliberate decision to sleep as
      an artistic statement, Yun‚Äôs piece emphasizes the absence of choice.</p>

          <h2>Invading the Dreaming Mind</h2>
        </div>

      <p>As mentioned in Chapter 1, when we fall asleep our muscles become
      paralyzed and the responsivity of our senses lowers. We no longer
      observe, actively listen to our environment, or are annoyed by the feel
      of the itchy duvet. Our alertness decreases, and it might seem we become
      disconnected from reality, but evolution wouldn‚Äôt allow it. We need to
      keep vigilance on guard in case of fire or sudden intruders. From all
      the stimuli, sounds and smells were proven to be the most successful in
      entering our dreamscapes. Robert Rich, 
      an ambient musician and composer
      used this knowledge when initiating <em>‚Äòsleep concerts‚Äô</em>. As a
      college freshman, he was trying to define his music direction and was
      interested in how music can be used as a ritual device and
      community-building tool. The idea of a sleep concert allowed him to
      gather people in the same space for long periods of time and play sound
      pieces lasting multiple hours. By doing so he also gave participants
      permission to not concentrate on the music and doze off. <a href="#fn20"

      <p>In 2021 I attended an event, inspired by Rich‚Äôs concerts, in Het Hem
      called <em>Slow Wave Phase ‚Äì Sleep In</em>. <a href="#fn21"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> I
      went there with two other friends and we spent the night in a large,
      exhibition hall, lit only by red lights. 
      We had singular beds that we
      pushed together to create our slumber island. Our sleep was accompanied
      by loud, electronic ambient music played by rotating DJs. We were
      surrounded by strangers who created their own bed clusters. The night
      was communal but intimate, the music was present in my sleep and
      continued when I woke up, the whole night felt like a fever dream. After
      this event, I became interested in how our surroundings can influence
      the way we perceive our consciousness. For instance, it‚Äôs a common
      experience that an alarm in the morning, instead of waking us up,
      accompanies our last dream of the night.</p>

      <p>This fascination with how external stimuli shape our perception of
      consciousness extends beyond personal experiences and into broader
      cultural trends. The rise of technology-driven approaches to sleep
      optimization reflects a growing collective interest in manipulating and
      enhancing our nighttime state. What was once an organic and unmonitored
      experience is now increasingly measured, tracked, and even altered by
      digital tools. It‚Äôs visible especially on a popular social media
      platform TikTok, which might be the best place to study tendencies and
      interests among the youngest generations. Recently we observed a rise in
      content associated with <em>sleepmaxxing</em> 
     
      trend. <a href="#fn22"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
      The creators focus on optimizing sleep by implementing various
      activities, products, and devices into their bedtime routines. From
      popular <em>Oura</em> rings, lavender eye pads, and red light masks, to
      sleep tracker apps and weighted blankets. Trends on TikTok are often
      characterized by strong saturation and excess of products, time, and
      effort involved. They tend to influence people to overconsume and obsess
      over otherwise mundane everyday activities. The technology involved in
      <em>sleepmaxxing</em> trend consists of smartwatches, rings, and apps
      that are promised to examine and track what happens with your body at
      night.</p>

      <p>The smartwatch can tell you when you are in your REM phase, evaluate
      the overall quality of your sleep, and track disturbances. Where is the
      boundary between safe health tracking and unwanted invasion? When
      observing those rapid technological developments we might wonder how
      they will evolve in the future. In 2021 marketing department of
      <em>Coors</em> saw an opportunity in this tightening bond between
      technology and sleep. They weren‚Äôt allowed to play their beer
      advertisement during the <em>Super Bowl</em> game, so they decided to
      experiment with implementing it into people‚Äôs dreams. <a href="#fn23"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
      The company created a campaign in collaboration with Deirdre Barrett,
      dream psychologist, and visual artist David Lawson. <em>Coors</em>
      encouraged people to watch a vivid animated video before bed and listen
      to a ten-hour soundscape throughout the night. The video consisted of 3D
      imaginary landscapes, watery creatures, and quick glimpses of
      <em>Coors</em> beer cans. It worked due to the collaborative approach of
      participants, eager to experiment with their own subconsciousness. The
      campaign is seen by experts as a ‚Äòtargeted dream incubation‚Äô, that could
      lead to a troubling future of weaponized and commercialized sleep. We
      might want to ask ourselves: Will sleep-tracking devices be able to soon
      infiltrate our dreams, using our decreased vigilance and extended trust
      in technology? As sleep concerts influence the way we dream, sounds
      targeted to advertise products can too. Your smartwatch detects when
      you‚Äôre in the deepest slumber and at the same time, in the most
      vulnerable state. Who knows if in the future smartwatches won‚Äôt incubate
      an advertisement into your sleep?</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      </div>

      <p>I wrote this thesis to explore a feeling I experienced while napping
      on a train one day. When I woke up abruptly, I felt exposed, as if I had
      revealed something intimate about myself to the outside world. It‚Äôs
      likely no one even noticed me, but the strange sensation of losing touch
      with reality while surrounded by strangers stayed with me. I decided to
      conduct this research from the perspective of an observer while
      investigating the figure of the sleeper.</p>
      <p>Sleep is an inherent part of our lives. It has been surrounded by
      mysteries and speculations for ages, as till recently we didn‚Äôt have a
      scientific explanation for why we sleep. These uncertainties have
      contributed to the creation of a mystical figure of the sleeper,
      symbolizing ideas of the unknown, death, transcendence, and the
      unconscious. Sleep has long been both unsettling, due to its resemblance
      to death, and fascinating, as the dreaming mind can drift beyond the
      boundaries of the waking world, touching what was often perceived as the
      divine. This ambiguity provided room for artistic expression and
      storytelling, allowing people to project their narratives onto the
      sleeper.</p>
      <p>Further, to sleep means to be vulnerable. The body relaxes, awareness
      fades, and the sleeper surrenders to an environment they can no longer
      control. This vulnerability and the mystery surrounding sleep have
      shaped the way it has been depicted in visual culture. The sleeper in
      classical art has been often used as an object‚Äîidealized, eroticized,
      and exposed.</p>
      <p>As technology advances, the vulnerable state of sleep is increasingly
      tracked, optimized, and measured. When these tools enter our private
      spaces and daily routines, the line between convenience and surveillance
      grows increasingly thin, giving room to potential exploitation.</p>
      <p>Through this research, I hoped to understand not only how sleep is
      represented but also how it reflects broader societal shifts‚Äîour
      relationship with technology, the boundaries of privacy, and the
      commercialization of even our most intimate moments.</p>
